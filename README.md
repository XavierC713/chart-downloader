This is a simple piece of software written in go which can download aviation charts from various sources to your local machine. The primary reason I created this was to automate downloading charts to the FlyByWire A32NX efb.

## How to Use
1. Make sure you have a recent version of the go compiler downloaded
2. Open a terminal and run `git clone https://github.com/XavierC713/chart-downloader.git`
3. cd into the newly created directory
4. Run the application using `go run .`
5. Follow the prompts
